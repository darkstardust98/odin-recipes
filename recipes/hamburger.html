    <h2>What a hambuger really is</h2>
    <p>A hamburger is a popular food item consisting of a cooked patty of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. It’s often served with various condiments and toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, and sauces. It originated in the United States and is a staple of fast-food cuisine, but is also made in gourmet styles. It’s named after the German city of Hamburg, though the dish itself was developed in the United States.</p>
    <h2>What ingredients are needed?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Burger Patty</strong>: This is typically made from ground meat. Beef is most common, but you can also use other meats like chicken, turkey, or even vegetarian options like beans or lentils.</li>
        <li><strong>Bun</strong>: The patty is served between two halves of a bun. Buns come in many varieties, including plain, sesame, whole wheat, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings</strong>: These can vary widely based on personal preference. Common toppings include lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and cheese. Sauces like ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise are also often used.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How is it made?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Patty</strong>: Mix ground meat with your chosen seasonings. Form the mixture into a patty shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Patty</strong>: Cook the patty on a grill or stovetop until it reaches your desired level of doneness. If you’re using cheese, add it on top of the patty near the end of the cooking time so it can melt.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Bun and Toppings</strong>: While the patty is cooking, slice your bun and prepare your chosen toppings. This could include washing lettuce, slicing tomatoes and onions, and so on.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Burger</strong>: Place the cooked patty on the bottom half of the bun. Add your toppings and any sauces you like, then place the top half of the bun on top.</li>
    </ol>
