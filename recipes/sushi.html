    <h2>What sushi really is</h2>
    <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that has gained worldwide popularity. It’s a unique culinary creation that consists of vinegared rice combined with various other ingredients. The most common of these are seafood (often raw), and vegetables.

        There are different types of sushi, each with its own preparation style and presentation. For instance, Nigiri is a type of sushi where a slice of raw fish is pressed onto a mound of vinegared rice. Maki, on the other hand, is sushi that’s rolled in seaweed sheets known as nori.
        
        The sushi is often served with soy sauce for dipping, and wasabi and pickled ginger on the side. Wasabi is a green paste with a strong, spicy flavor, and the pickled ginger serves as a palate cleanser.
        
        Visually, sushi is as much an art form as it is a food. The colors of the fresh ingredients, the precision of the cuts, and the meticulous assembly result in a dish that’s pleasing to both the eye and the palate. So, sushi is not just about taste, it’s also about aesthetic presentation.
        
        Remember, sushi is meant to be eaten in one bite, and it’s perfectly acceptable to use your hands or chopsticks. Enjoying sushi is a sensory experience that involves taste, texture, and aroma. It’s a delightful introduction to the rich and diverse world of Japanese cuisine.</p>
    <h2>What ingredients are needed?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sushi Rice (Sumeshi)</strong>: This is the most essential ingredient in sushi. It’s medium-grain white rice seasoned with sweetened vinegar12.</li>
        <li><strong>Nori Seaweed</strong>: These are the sheets used to roll the sushi1.</li>
        <li><strong>Seafood</strong>: Sushi is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. The seafood can be both raw and cooked12.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables</strong>: Common vegetables used in sushi include cucumber and avocado. They are usually cut into long thin strips13.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How is it made?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Rice</strong>: Rinse 2 cups of sushi rice under running water until the water runs clear1. Cook the rice in a saucepan with enough water to submerge the rice1. After the water boils, let the rice cook for about 10 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Season the Rice</strong>: Mix rice vinegar dressing and fold it into the cooked rice2. This gives the rice its unique sushi flavor</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Sushi</strong>: Lay a nori (seaweed) sheet on a bamboo mat, shiny-side down1. Spread a layer of the seasoned rice on the nori, leaving a small space at the edge furthest from you clear1. Add your chosen fillings</li>
        <li><strong>Roll and Cut the Sushi</strong>: Using the bamboo mat, start rolling the nori over the ingredients4. Apply gentle pressure to keep everything in a tight roll4. Once you reach the edge without any rice, brush it with a little water and continue to roll into a tight roll3. Finally, remove the mat and cut the sushi into bite-sized pieces</li>
    </ol>
