# odin-recipes

This is the first project I am doing via TOP and it is aimed to practice the HTML concepts I learned.

It is a simple website with recipes.

Self-reflections:



NOTE 1

I just added the style.css file to my project and I am immediately grasping why TOP is so loved by the community.

I am learning way more now than I was by following all the tutorials and courses scattered around the web.

I am learning. I am having fun. I am getting used to the idea of doing this for a living. And I am finally realizing that with hard work this is achievable.



NOTE 2

I just added margin, paddig and borders to the website and thanks to TOP I am learning how to structure a website stylistically.

I have been making websites with shopify for some years now, but finally understanding how everything works under the hood is really exciting.


NOTE 3 

I just added the flexbox section with flavours, but I still find it a bit confusing. I'll try my best to exercise to get better.
I am having fun with the styling part and trying different color combinations.
