# odin-recipes

This is the first project I am doing via TOP and it is aimed to practice the HTML concepts I learned.

It is a simple website with recipes.

Self-reflections:


NOTE 1

I just added the style.css file to my project and I am immediately grasping why TOP is so loved by the community.

I am learning way more now than I was by following all the tutorials and courses scattered around the web.

I am learning. I am having fun. I am getting used to the idea of doing this for a living. And I am finally realizing that with hard work this is achievable.
